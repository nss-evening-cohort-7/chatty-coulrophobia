Now our user has cleared out all the old messages and created 3 new ones. Note the different senders and use of emojis.

The user has clicked on the `edit` button. The message text has been placed in the input box at the top of the window. In addition, the message being edited has been identified with a thick, red border.

If a user clicks on the emoji in the input field, a dropdown of emojis appears. The user is able to pick one of many emojis to use in their messages to other users. The `npm` dependency [lsx-emojipicker](https://github.com/LascauxSRL/lsx-emojipicker) was used to create this functionality.

When the user clicks the `Custom` button, a modal appears. This allows the user to select any background color and text colors for the messages.
